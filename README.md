## Overview

For this project, we'll be analyzing Amazon reviews that have been writted by members from the **Amazon Vine program**, a service the allows both manufactures & publishers to recieve reviews to determine if there are any biaces of their products from **Vine** team members & **Non-Vine** members.

Companies paying a fee to Amazon may provide some free products to it's members, are then required to publish a review to help determine if there are biased feedback between Vine members & Non-members. We'll compare or identify 5 start ratings to overall ratings. This exercise, were asked to choose from 50 datasets and extract, transform & load information into a dataframe to complete or analysis.
